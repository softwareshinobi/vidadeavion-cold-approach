## Background
This project was originally developed for a hackathon. It was my first JavaScript project, inspired by the need to rest my eyes after working for extended periods. The timer is designed to enhance productivity for students while studying.

## Features
- Customizable work and break durations
- Audible alerts to notify session changes
- Robust, user-friendly interface

## What I learned
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)

## Installation
To use the timer, simply clone this repository. No additional dependencies or package managers are required. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidsurakanti/pomodoro-timer.git

## Usage
1. Visit the [website](https://potimer.vercel.app)
2. Modify the durations for breaks and work sessions according to your preferences in the settings tab
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer
4. During the work session, focus on your tasks until the timer elapses
5. When the timer switches to the break session, take a short break and relax
6. Repeat the work and break sessions as necessary
